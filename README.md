# Projects_for_intership
This repo contains all the projects that I have done in the last few months. Most of them are in python. Few of them are in C.
 Some of them are:
 
 1.sudoku_solver- This code takes a unsolved sudoku and returns the final answer to given sudoku.If no answer exist it returns "The given sudoku cannot be solved :(".
 
 2.Calculator GUI- It is a simple project in python where I have used Kivy. Kivy is a free, Open Source Python library that enables the rapid and easy development of highly interactive cross-platform applications. Kivyâ€™s execution speed is the same as compared to the other mobile development alternatives like Java for Android and Objective C for iOS.
 
 3.binary_search- This is a project on simple use of recursive approach to get the element present in a sorted list.
 
 4.music_recommend- This is a machine learning project where I can know what kind of music a person loves to listen on basis on his/her age.I have used libraries like numpy,pandas and sklearn.
 
 5.Reading_from_URL- This project has additonal function-"WebData".Here I can read public data returned from URL, and parsing JSON to dictionary object. 
 
 6.python_list_in_C-    I have implemented Python List Data structure and the APIs associated with it, but in C programming language. One way to achieve this is to use pointers to handle this dynamic nature of the Python Lists (since arrays in C are static). In this way, a list is made up of some "nodes" that contain pointers of the next node; therefore you can move or "traverse" the list by moving through the pointers stored in each node. Therefore, we only need to store the "location" of the first node i.e.
the head (of course, we store this location using a pointer).

7.Organisation Hierarchy- This is a project in C language. Here we can know the position of each employee working in a company.I have used nodes and linked list to create this function.
